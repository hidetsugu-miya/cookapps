// E2E only: sits under every invoke of the app. Loaded after the plugin and before the app.
// On WKWebView `core.invoke` and `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` are read-only, so the plugin cannot intercept the app's calls itself;
// but `window.__TAURI__.core` is writable, so it is replaced by a copy with a wrapped `invoke`. `ts/ipc.ts` reads `invoke` from it after this script ran.
// Order of lookup: a spec's `mock(...)` in e2e/support.ts (window.__e2e_mocks__), then the fixtures, then the base answers below, else reject.
// Every app command call is recorded in window.__e2e_calls__[command] as its argument list, for `callsOf` in e2e/support.ts.
// Both live in the page, so a reload clears them. (@wdio/tauri-service's own `mock` is not used: it does not put the mock back into a reloaded page.)
// Every command the app calls at startup has a harmless base answer, so no test can reach Gmail, the keychain or Slack.
// To change what the app sees at startup, put {command: value} in sessionStorage["e2e-fixtures"] and reload (`boot` in e2e/support.ts does it).
// An unmocked command is also recorded in window.__e2e_unmocked__: the app swallows some rejections, and wdio.conf.ts prints the list when a test fails.
// The window is never shown (visible: false in tauri.e2e.conf.json), and WKWebView then reports document.hidden and runs no animation frames,
// which would stop the app's sync, Todo refresh and its requestAnimationFrame work. Make the page behave as in a shown window.
